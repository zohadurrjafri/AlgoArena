    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "description": "Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n. The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.",
    "example": {
      "Input": "n=10",
      "Output": "182",
      "Explanation": "- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1\n- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1, sum = 9\n- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100, partitioned into 10 and 0, sum = 10\nHence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182"
